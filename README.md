ðŸŽµ Music Store Data Analysis Project Using SQL ðŸŽµ

I'm excited to share my recent project where I leveraged SQL for in-depth data analysis of a music store's database. This project involved extracting, transforming, and analyzing large datasets to derive actionable insights. Key highlights include:

Data Extraction: Retrieved data from various tables, including customers, tracks, albums, and sales.

Data Transformation: Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Analytical Queries: Developed complex SQL queries to analyze customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and track popularity.

Insights & Reporting: Identified top-selling genres and artists, seasonal sales trends, and high-value customers. Created comprehensive reports and visualizations to communicate findings.

This project not only honed my SQL skills but also enhanced my ability to translate data into strategic business insights. Looking forward to applying these skills in a professional setting!
